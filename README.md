## 💼 What it does
- Turns **“Software Engineer”** into things like  
  *Global Visionary Software Engineer Strategist · 10x*  
- Works beyond tech → project managers, founders, nurses, marketers… all get their own flavor of chaos.  
- Each run is seeded, so you can **share a link** and friends will see the same cursed list.  
- Light/dark mode toggle, one-click copy, max 16 absurd titles at a time.

## 🎯 Why
Because LinkedIn titles were never meant to be this serious. Neither is this little project.

This generator leans into the exaggeration, buzzwords, and corporate theater — so you don’t have to.
